# password-generator

This homework is coveering a password generator that has different criteria and allows the user to choose what and how long they want their password to be like. You will first be brought to an HTML page with a button, a box and a prompt to generate a password.

Pressing the button should start the prompts and move to the quesiton of how long you want your password to be. You have to choose between 8-128 characters and then it will prompt ypu in 4 prompts to add numbers or special characters to it. LET is replacing VAR ad a trial and learn tactic, since it seems you can interchange them. You need to have at least one special character or number choice or it will ask you to pick one and restart the prompt again.

These values will be calculated and then pushed down into a random.numver/value generator and will push out a password. This will be in a for loop using the push function.

The last function was provided by the HW and is the final step in generating the password using all the information from the push and confirm lines and random math function above.
